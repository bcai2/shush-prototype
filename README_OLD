Current workflow:

Data updates (if needed)
- copy edges/synonyms data from google sheet to edges_sheet.txt, synonyms.txt
- generate graph nodes/edges with clean.py
- copy graph_visjs_data.txt fields over to graph_data.js

Webapp updates
- just edit index.js/index.html/index.css as needed

this is not ideal but the prototype works. this will be cleaned/automated if iterations require it
